{"id":"predicte-dpv","title":"Separate language-specific functions into dedicated files","description":"The file src/utils/codeUtils.ts contains mixed concerns - general utilities and language-specific functions. This makes the code harder to maintain and organize. Create separate files for language-specific functions like:\n\n- fixHtmlJsxSpacing → create htmlJsxUtils.ts\n- Language-specific parameter configuration → languageConfig.ts\n\nThis follows the Single Responsibility Principle and improves code organization.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-03T00:21:45.835822676+07:00","created_by":"satrya","updated_at":"2026-01-03T00:24:18.566611932+07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-03T00:24:18.566611932+07:00","close_reason":"Cleared by user request"}
